# MongoDB Setup

Our application relies on a locally hosted MongoDB database.

Please follow the instructions provided by the MongoDB website below to start up an empty database on your machine:
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

# Application Setup

The first step is to cd into the backend and create a .env file
```
cd backend
touch .env
```
This stores all the necessary environment variables and parameters used by the Node.js/Express.js server.
We will then place this into the .env file:

NOTE: If you have configured MongoDB to use a different port, please change the MONGO_URI property
below.

```
MONGO_URI = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
PORT = 4000
MAXIMUM_EDIT_DISTANCE = 20
FORGOT_PASS_EXPIRATION_TIME_HOURS = 10

EMAIL_USER=bookexchangeucla@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=dpbg rxie ivvk mevl

JWT_SECRET=chocolateisthebest
TOKEN_HEADER_KEY=Authorization
FRONTEND_ORIGIN = http://localhost:3000
```

Then, create a .env file for the frontend
```
cd ../frontend
touch .env
```

This is used to allow the frontend to know how to talk to the server.

This should include:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Once this has been inserted, you may run npm install in the command line in both backend and frontend in order to start both sides of the application.

From here, it's easiest to have the server statically serve the frontend, allowing you to run the entire project
over one port. To do this, navigate to the backend directory and type the following commands:
```
npm run build-react
npm start
```

From here the app should be ready to run :).
